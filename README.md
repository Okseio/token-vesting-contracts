Okse Contracts needed 

1. JulD Airdrop Contract 

active from 01st of July until 01st of August 
User can stake JulD, he can stake as much juld as he want and he can add as often as he want juld to the stake 
User can withdrawal his juld after the contract ends which means on the 01st of August 
Based on the JulD Balance from the User at the end of the contract on the 01st of August he can claim every month the next 36 month Okse 

Lets say you deposit 
on the 01st of July 10,000 juld 
on the 10th of july 50,000 juld 
on the 30th july 10,000 juld 
on the 01st august 30,000 juld before the contract close 

Now the contract closed and in total you deposited 100,000 JulD 

The airdrop is 1 juld = 0.25 okse means you get 25,000 Okse which you can claim over the next 36 month and the first time on the 01st of September where he gets 694.44 Okse because 25,000 / 36 month = 694.44 Okse every month the next 36 month.  

Every wallet who staked can claim based on the periods his okse with his own wallet from which he staked. 

We deposit the amount of Okse into the Contract after the contract ends after the 01st of august but before the 01st of september. The people can claim whenever they want if they have something to claim so there is no need to claim monthly, they can claim once a year as well but if they claim, they claim all whats available for them. If there are still tokens in the contract 3 month after the 36 month ends, this tokens will be burned!
